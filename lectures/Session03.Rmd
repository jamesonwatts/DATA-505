## Calculating correlation

```{r}
wine %>% 
  summarise(cor_p=cor(price,points),cor_lp=cor(lprice,points))
```

## Exercise

1. Calculate the correlation between log(price) and points 
2. by variety
3. for Oregon Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Gris
4. in the same tibble

## Solution

```{r}
wine %>% 
  filter(province=="Oregon") %>% 
  filter(variety %in% c("Chardonnay","Pinot Noir","Pinot Gris")) %>% 
  group_by(variety) %>% 
  summarise(correlation=cor(lprice,points))
```

## Visualizing these different correlations

```{r}
wine %>% 
  filter(province=="Oregon") %>% 
  filter(variety %in% c("Chardonnay","Pinot Noir","Pinot Gris")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(points,lprice, color=variety)) +
    geom_point(alpha=0.3)+
    facet_wrap(~variety)+
    geom_smooth(method = lm)
    
```


## Graphing residuals (bad)

```{r}
model <- lm(price~points, filter(wine,province=="Oregon"))
get_regression_points(model) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(points, residual))+
    geom_point()
```

## Graphing residuals (good)

```{r}
model <- lm(lprice~points, filter(wine,province=="Oregon"))
get_regression_points(model) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(points, residual))+
    geom_point()
```


## Interpreting the coefficients

```{r}
model <- lm(lprice~points, filter(wine,province=="Oregon"))
pct = (exp(coef(model)["points"]) - 1) * 100
```

Since we logged the DV, a 1 point ratings increase = ``r round(pct,2)``\% increase in price on average. 

Note: $$ (e^x-1)*100 $$

## Even moar awesomer with some code fu

```{r}
for(v in c("Chardonnay", "Pinot Gris","Pinot Noir")){
  m <- lm(lprice~points, filter(wine,province=="Oregon", variety==v))
  pct <- round((exp(coef(m)["points"]) - 1) * 100,2)
  print(str_c("For ",v,", a 1 point ratings increase leads to a ",pct,"% increase in price."))
}
```

## Logged feature

```{r}
model <- lm(price~lpoints, filter(wine,province=="Oregon") %>% mutate(lpoints=log(points)))
model
inc = coef(model)["lpoints"]/100
```

Since we logged the IV (feature), a 1% ratings increase = ``r round(inc,2)`` increase in price on average. 

Note: $$ x/100 $$

## LogLog (also elasticity)

```{r}
model <- lm(lprice~lpoints, filter(wine,province=="Oregon") %>% mutate(lpoints=log(points)))
model
```

...a 1\% increase in ratings equals a ``r round(coef(model)["lpoints"],2)``\% increase in price on average

## Summary

- Only the dependent/response variable is log-transformed. Exponentiate the coefficient, subtract one from this number, and multiply by 100. This gives the percent increase (or decrease) in the response for every one-unit increase in the independent variable. Example: the coefficient is 0.198. (exp(0.198) – 1) * 100 = 21.9. For every one-unit increase in the independent variable, our dependent variable increases by about 22%.
- Only independent/predictor variable(s) is log-transformed. Divide the coefficient by 100. This tells us that a 1% increase in the independent variable increases (or decreases) the dependent variable by (coefficient/100) units. Example: the coefficient is 0.198. 0.198/100 = 0.00198. For every 1% increase in the independent variable, our dependent variable increases by about 0.002. 
- Both dependent/response variable and independent/predictor variable(s) are log-transformed. Interpret the coefficient as the percent increase in the dependent variable for every 1% increase in the independent variable. Example: the coefficient is 0.198. For every 1% increase in the independent variable, our dependent variable increases by about 0.20%. 

## Graphing points by variety
```{r}
wine %>% 
  filter(province=="Oregon") %>% 
  filter(variety %in% c("Chardonnay","Pinot Noir","Pinot Gris")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(variety,points))+
    geom_boxplot()
```

## Summary
```{r}
(tmp <- wine %>% 
  filter(province=="Oregon") %>% 
  filter(variety %in% c("Chardonnay","Pinot Noir","Pinot Gris")) %>% 
  group_by(variety) %>% 
  summarise(mean=mean(points)))
```

Note: 

1. The difference between Pinot Gris and Chardonnay is `r tmp[["mean"]][2]-tmp[["mean"]][1]`
2. The difference between Pinot Noir and Chardonnay is `r tmp[["mean"]][3]-tmp[["mean"]][1]`

## Regression
```{r}
model <- lm(points~variety, 
            filter(wine,province=="Oregon",variety %in% c("Chardonnay","Pinot Noir","Pinot Gris")))
get_regression_table(model)
```

What is the equation for this regression?


## Assumptions of linear regression

1. **L**inearity of relationship between variables
2. **I**ndependence of the residuals
3. **N**ormality of the residuals
4. **E**quality of variance of the residuals

## Linearity of relationship

What would the residuals look like?

## Independence

Given our original model of $log(price)=m*Points+b$... 

### ...are there any problems with independence?

## Normality
```{r}
model <- lm(lprice~points, filter(wine,province=="Oregon"))
get_regression_points(model) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(residual))+
    geom_histogram(color="white")
```

## Equality of variance

```{r}
get_regression_points(model) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(points, residual))+
    geom_jitter(alpha=0.2)
```

## No equality in the variance

# Dinner (and vitural high fives)

# Preprocessing and BoxCox

## Setup

```{r}
library(caret)
library(class)
library(fastDummies)
# wine <- as.data.frame(read_rds("../resources/pinot.rds"))
wine <- read_rds("../resources/pinot.rds")

```

# Preprocessing

Box-Cox transformations use MLE to estimate $\lambda$

$x^{*} = \frac{x^{\lambda}-1}{\lambda\: \tilde{x}^{\lambda-1}}$

- when $\lambda=1$, there is no transformation
- when $\lambda=0$, it is log transformed
- when $\lambda=0.5$, it is square root
- when $\lambda=-1$, it is an inverse

## Caret preprocessing is so easy!

```{r}
wine %>% 
  preProcess(method = c("BoxCox","center","scale")) %>% 
  predict(wine) %>% 
  select(-description) %>% 
  head()
```

But wait... what is wrong here?

```{r}
wino <- wine %>%
  mutate(year_f = as.factor(year))

wino <- wino %>% 
  preProcess(method = c("BoxCox","center","scale")) %>% 
  predict(wino)

head(wino %>% select(starts_with("year")))
```


# The KNN Algorithm

## Algorithm

1. Load the data
2. Initialize K to your chosen number of neighbors
3. For each example in the data
  1. Calculate the distance between the query example and the current example from the data.
  2. Add the distance and the index of the example to an ordered collection
4. Sort the ordered collection of distances and indices from smallest to largest (in ascending order) by the distances
5. Pick the first K entries from the sorted collection
6. Get the labels of the selected K entries
7. If regression, return the mean of the K labels
8. If classification, return the mode of the K labels

## Engineering some features

```{r}
wino <- wino %>% 
  mutate(taster_name = fct_lump(taster_name,5)) %>% 
  dummy_cols(
    select_columns = c("year_f","taster_name"),
    remove_most_frequent_dummy = T, 
    remove_selected_columns = T) %>% 
  rename_all(funs(tolower(.))) %>% 
  rename_all(funs(str_replace_all(., "-", "_"))) %>% 
  rename_all(funs(str_replace_all(., " ", "_"))) %>% 
  mutate(cherry = str_detect(description,"cherry")) %>% 
  mutate(chocolate = str_detect(description,"chocolate")) %>%
  mutate(earth = str_detect(description,"earth")) %>%
  select(-description)

head(wino) %>% 
  select(1:8)
```

## Simple model

```{r}
set.seed(504)
wine_index <- createDataPartition(wino$province, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
train <- wino[ wine_index, ]
test <- wino[-wine_index, ]

fit <- knn(
  train = select(train,-province), 
  test = select(test,-province), 
  k=5, 
  cl = train$province, 
  prob = T)
```

## Confusion matrix

```{r}
confusionMatrix(fit,factor(test$province))
```


## Kappa statistic

Compares observed accuracy against what would be expected by a random classifier. 

- \< 0.2 (not so good)
- 0.21 - 0.4 (ok)
- 0.41 - 0.6 (pretty good)
- 0.6 - 0.8 (great)
- \> 0.8 (almost perfect)

...whoa! What's going on here?

## Fixing the leak

```{r}
wino <- select(wino, -starts_with("taster")) # get rid of the taster variables

set.seed(504)
wine_index <- createDataPartition(wino$province, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
train <- wino[ wine_index, ]
test <- wino[-wine_index, ]

fit <- knn(
  train = select(train,-province), 
  test = select(test,-province), 
  k=5, 
  cl = train$province, 
  prob = T)
```

## Confusion matrix

```{r tidy=T, strip.white=T, comment=""}
confusionMatrix(fit,factor(test$province))
```

## Basic model with parameter tuning

```{r}
control <- trainControl(method = "boot", number = 1)
fit <- train(province ~ .,
             data = train, 
             method = "knn",
             tuneLength = 15,
             trControl = control)
fit
```


## Confusion Matrix
```{r}
confusionMatrix(predict(fit, test),factor(test$province))
```

```

## With parameter tuning and subsampling

```{r}
fit <- train(province ~ .,
             data = train, 
             method = "knn",
             tuneLength = 15,
             metric = "Kappa",
             trControl = control)

fit
```

## Tuning plot

```{r}
ggplot(fit, metric="Kappa")
```


## Group modeling problem I

* Practice running different versions of the model
* Create some new features and
* see if you can achieve a Kappa >= 0.5


## Bonus: KNN for regression

```{r}
fit <- train(price ~ .,
             data = train, 
             method = "knn",
             tuneLength = 15,
             trControl = control)
fit

```
